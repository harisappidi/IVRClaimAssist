# ðŸ“ž IVRClaimAssist

**IVRClaimAssist** is a voice-based IVR (Interactive Voice Response) chatbot that streamlines the customer experience for rental car repair tracking. It is specifically designed to **bridge the gap between customers and car rental companies like Enterprise**, by automating the process of checking repair status updatesâ€”eliminating long wait times, redundant identity verification, and unnecessary call transfers.

Built with **Twilio Programmable Voice**, **Node.js (Express.js)**, and **Firebase Firestore**, IVRClaimAssist provides a simple and scalable way for customers to retrieve real-time repair updates through a phone call.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem It Solves

When a customer reports vehicle damage to a rental company (e.g., Enterprise), they receive a **claim number** to track the **car repair process**. But when they call customer support for status updates, the experience is often inefficient:

- Multiple teams get involved.
- Customers have to **verify identity twice** (name, mailing address).
- Call transfers cause **long wait times (5+ minutes)**.
- Updates like "parts ordered", "car inspected", or "repair in progress" require **manual queries by agents**.

These repetitive steps waste timeâ€”especially when the customer is on a **deadline (e.g., 60-day claim limit from a credit card company like Amex)** to gather repair documentation.

**IVRClaimAssist** solves this by giving the customer a **self-service voice bot** that:
- Accepts phone calls.
- Verifies the caller once.
- Fetches real-time repair status via an internal API or Firestore.
- Speaks back the results immediately.
